# cojo_django_fullstackbooks
coding dojo, python, django, orm: "Full Stack Books" assignment

Make a new project that can display a list of books, including authors and categories.

Your model will be similar to the one we used in the previous books assignment. This one is just a little more simple. You should be focused on generating rows from user input and displaying all the Book data in a table in your HTML template. You already know how to add and retrieve information.
